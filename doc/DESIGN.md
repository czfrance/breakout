# Breakout Design
## Cynthia France


## Design Goals
* Make this as fun as possible!
* My goal is to implement everything in my plan

## High-Level Design
* At the very core, there will be a Breakout class which uses classes such as Ball, Paddle, and
  Block to play the game
* Ball, Paddle, and Block will interact with each other in the game to produce desired effects

## Assumptions or Simplifications
* Set to 3 lives per level
* Arbitrary ball, paddle, window sizes were chosen
* Arbitrary ball & block speeds were chosen

## Changes from the Plan
* I did not implement power-up/disadvantage/mixed snow flurries, or any flurries at all
* I also slightly changed a planned power-up and added another cheat key.
* NOTE: I was not aware of this document, so I documented all power-up and cheat key changes
    in the ``PLAN.md`` document
  * The only exception is snow flurries, I kept that part in
